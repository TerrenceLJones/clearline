# clearline

A monorepo of standalone fintech frontend projects, each demoable and discussable independently. Every project is scoped around a specific fintech domain and modeled around real business rules, failure modes, and data-integrity constraints — not happy-path CRUD. The flagship (and currently only) project is **Clearline**.

## Clearline — B2B Spend Management & Payments

> Corporate spend platform in the style of Ramp, Brex, and Mercury.

Clearline is a web-only frontend that models the parts of a spend platform where correctness actually matters: idempotent vendor payments, multi-level approvals with separation of duties, role-based access control, business onboarding/KYB, and (planned) a double-entry ledger with derived balances, AI-assisted invoice coding, and reconciliation.

The focus is fidelity to real failure modes — idempotency-key replay, partial-failure batch approvals, SoD enforcement, daily-limit and self-transfer guards, network-retry with full-jitter backoff — modeled explicitly in pure domain logic and surfaced honestly in the UI.

## Architecture

Clearline is layered so that **business rules never depend on React, HTTP, or the DOM**. Each concern lives in its own Nx library, and module boundaries are enforced by `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries`.

   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Cross-cutting: libs/ui · libs/design-tokens · libs/icons
                  libs/util/money · libs/contracts
   Backend seam:  libs/mock-backend  (MSW v2, stateful services)
```

**The layering rule of thumb:** if it's a business invariant it lives in `domain`; if it talks to the network it lives in `data-access`; if it renders it lives in `ui` or the app. For example, the single `validatePayment` gate (balance, daily limit, self-transfer, recipient status) is pure domain logic; the React Query hook that mints an `Idempotency-Key`, applies a 30s timeout, and retries 5xx with full-jitter backoff is data-access; the form that shows the resulting typed error is UI.

### Mock backend

There is no separate backend service. `libs/mock-backend` is an **MSW v2** implementation where **stateful TypeScript services hold the invariants** (balances, idempotency records, approval state) and MSW handlers are thin HTTP/WebSocket adapters in front of them. This lets the frontend exercise realistic server behavior — replayed idempotency keys, validation 4xx, partial batch failures — entirely in the browser and in tests. See `TDR-PLATFORM-001 > shared_mock_backend_strategy`.

### Demo Beacon

Because the app runs entirely on the mock backend, a tester needs to know what seed data exists and what inputs each page will accept. The **Demo Beacon** answers that in-place: a floating launcher in the bottom-right corner opens a **page-aware** panel describing the current page's seeded data and scenarios — no reading fixture files.

It's a standalone, project-agnostic library (`libs/demo-beacon`, `@clearline/demo-beacon`) modeled on the Help Scout Beacon. Its only runtime dependencies are React and `@radix-ui/react-dialog`; it's themed via `--beacon-*` CSS variables and imports no app, router, or backend code, so it can be lifted into another project.

**What a tester gets, per page:**

- **Login** — the seeded demo credentials to copy, and a toggle to simulate an auth outage.
- **Dashboard** — one-click **role switching** (Employee / Finance Manager / Controller) to watch the nav and permissions re-scope, plus a **Reset demo data** control.
- **Approvals** — the seeded queue and which items trip the over-limit (Escalate) and self-approval (Reassign) guardrails.
- **New payment** — the full account/routing numbers (the page shows only masked forms) for the "Recipient not listed?" hand-entry flow, and the amount thresholds that trip the daily-limit / insufficient-funds blocks.
- **Onboarding** — the EINs the mock registry accepts, and the names/EINs that route to manual review.
- **Reconciliation** — the seeded exceptions (a fuzzy suggestion, an unmatched line, a splittable transaction, a duplicate), with one-click toggles to break a panel or trip the Fatal-tier balance-integrity state.
- **Audit Log** — the seeded cross-cutting events (payment, approval, card freeze, role change) and the self-referential "your access is logged" behavior, with a pointer to the role switch that proves the Controller-only restriction.

**How it works:** each page calls `useDemoBeacon(config)` to register its guide while mounted; a single `DemoBeaconProvider` in `App.tsx` owns the store and renders the launcher. Anything side-effectful (navigation, backend simulation, reset) crosses the boundary as a callback the app supplies. Config lives beside each page in colocated `*.beacon.ts` files (`apps/clearline-web/src/**/*.beacon.ts`) and shared helpers in `src/dev/beacon/`.

See [`libs/demo-beacon/README.md`](libs/demo-beacon/README.md) for the config API.

**When it appears:** automatically in local dev, and in a hosted demo build that sets `VITE_ENABLE_MOCKS=true`. A real production build leaves that unset — the store still mounts (page hooks are harmless no-ops) but the launcher/panel UI chunk is never loaded, so it costs nothing. Gating lives in `apps/clearline-web/src/dev/demo-mode.ts`.

## Project status

The frontend framework decision is settled (React 19 + Vite) and `clearline-web` is a running application, not a placeholder.

**Implemented:**

- **EPIC-CW-000** — Design system foundation (`design-tokens`, `icons`, `ui`, fully tested + storied)
- **EPIC-CW-001 / 016** — Authentication, session management, and account sign-up
- **EPIC-CW-002** — Business onboarding & KYB
- **EPIC-CW-003** — Role-based access control & permissions
- **EPIC-CW-004** — Vendor payments & transfers (idempotent payment flow, validation gate, FX quote)
- **EPIC-CW-005** — 3DS / step-up authentication for high-value payments
- **EPIC-CW-006** — Expense submission & approval workflow (separation of duties, limit-based escalation, stale-action reconciliation)
- **EPIC-CW-007** — Batch operations (partial-failure batch approve/reject, per-item idempotency keys, mid-batch resume)
- **EPIC-CW-008** — Card management (virtual card issuance with limits + MCC restrictions, real-time WebSocket transaction feed, freeze controls, security-gated declines)
- **EPIC-CW-009** — Real-time spend dashboard & analytics (category/department/vendor breakdowns, anomaly flags with AI confidence, per-section error boundaries with scoped retry, date-range filtering, data-freshness with manual refresh)
- **EPIC-CW-010** — Vendor management & reconciliation (nightly bank-feed reconciliation with exact + fuzzy matching, an actionable exceptions queue, confirm/reject fuzzy suggestions with a similarity breakdown, manual split-match with exact-sum validation, and a Fatal-tier ledger-balance-integrity guard that withholds a balance that doesn't net)
- **EPIC-CW-013** — Budget management (department monthly budgets, real-time gauges with accessible on-track/80%-warning/over-budget states — icon + text, never color alone — threshold-crossing stakeholder notifications, and monthly period rollover with a per-department Budget History view; currency-exact percentage/overage math via minor units)
- **EPIC-CW-019** — Account owner provisioning at KYB approval
- **EPIC-CW-020** — Reassign approver for blocked approvals
- **EPIC-CW-021** — Sidebar navigation shell (top-nav → side-nav migration: persistent left rail with role-scoped vertical nav, a user-identity footer showing role + approval limit, the relocated theme control, and a narrow-viewport off-canvas drawer)
- **EPIC-CW-022** — Settings & Profile (the full `/settings` surface: a role-scoped two-tier SettingsNav; Personal Info, Notifications, and Account Security — password, dependency-free authenticator-app 2FA, session/trusted-device review; the Organization group — Company Profile, relocated Team & Members, Approval Policies & Spend Controls, Card Program & Connected Accounts, Accounting Integrations & Org Notifications, Security & Compliance with an atomic re-auth-gated Ownership Transfer, Developer API keys & webhooks, and Billing & Plan with a type-the-company-name cancellation + post-cancellation read-only grace; plus a sidebar-footer user menu with Log out. Secrets shown exactly once; client hides, server decides; destructive actions name what they destroy)
- **EPIC-CW-014** — Accessibility (cross-cutting, WCAG 2.1 AA): non-color status/risk/budget indicators, a global ≥3px keyboard focus ring (with a forced-colors fallback), spoken `MoneyDisplay` aria-labels, form errors associated to their field via `aria-describedby` and announced through a live region, and focus-trapped confirmation dialogs that announce the countdown and cancel on Escape
- **EPIC-CW-015** — Audit logging (cross-cutting): a central, immutable, append-only audit store that payments, approvals, and card controls all emit into (rather than a log duplicated per feature), surfaced as a Controller-only Audit Log view with who / what / when and a before→after diff — where opening the view is itself an audited action, and no update or delete path exists at any layer (corrections are appended, never edits)

**Planned** (see `specs/epics/clearline-web/`): AI invoice coding, AI spend insights (streaming), plus organization & team management.

## Node version

This repo requires **Node 24** (`engines.node` in `package.json`). Use
[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) to get it automatically — `mise.toml` at the repo root pins Node
24 and pnpm 9.15.1:

```bash
mise install       # once, per machine
mise trust         # approve this repo's mise.toml
```

---

## Running locally

```bash
pnpm install

# run the Clearline app (Vite dev server)
pnpm nx run clearline-web:dev

# browse the Clearline design system
pnpm nx run ui:storybook

# unit tests (everything) / e2e
pnpm nx run-many --target=test --all
pnpm nx run clearline-web:e2e
```

The **Demo Beacon** (see above) is on automatically in the dev server — look for the launcher in the bottom-right corner. Sign in with the credentials it shows on the login page. To turn it on for a hosted demo deploy, set `VITE_ENABLE_MOCKS=true` in that environment (it also enables the MSW mock backend); leave it unset for a real production build.

**Always run `lint`/`type-check`/`test`/`build` through Nx** (`pnpm nx run <project>:<target>`
or `pnpm nx run-many --target=...`), not a bare `tsc`/`vitest` inside a `libs/*` folder.
`libs/ui` and `libs/icons` consume `libs/design-tokens`/`libs/icons` via TypeScript project
references, which requires those dependencies' declaration files to already be built —
`nx.json`'s `type-check: { dependsOn: ["^build"] }` (and the same for `test`) is what makes
that happen automatically. Running `tsc` directly, bypassing Nx, will fail with `TS6305` until
you've built the dependencies yourself.

### Regenerating tokens and icons

`libs/design-tokens` and `libs/icons` are generated from JSON sources, kept as the single
input for each package:

```bash
# after editing libs/design-tokens/tokens.source.json
pnpm --filter @clearline/design-tokens generate

# after editing libs/icons/icons.source.json
pnpm --filter @clearline/icons generate
```

## AI usage

AI tools (Claude, GitHub Copilot) are used throughout this repo — from initial research and architecture planning through design, scaffolding, and code generation. This is a deliberate workflow choice: AI accelerates the work without replacing the engineering judgment behind it. Domain invariants, architectural decisions, state machine design, and review of all AI-generated output are human-owned.
